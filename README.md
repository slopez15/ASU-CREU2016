I have had many people want to learn web-scraping and so I suggest you check out my team's weekly journals about what we found on web-scraping. https://sites.google.com/a/asu.edu/creu-saulslopez/partner-pages

What to keep in mind when trying out web-scraping:
* Headless vs Head. 
* Scraping static vs dynamic data. 
* Scraping tools for many different programming languages. 
* Selenuim pros/cons. 

Many key information is in this journal post: https://sites.google.com/a/asu.edu/creu-saulslopez/blogs/week20

Your Welcome!
